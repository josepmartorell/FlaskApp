# FlaskApp :smiling_imp:
Flask is a "micro" Framework written in Python and conceived to facilitate the development of Web Applications under the MVC pattern. In the Python world, the best known framework is Django, however there are other options with a much friendlier learning curve, and this is the case with Flask.

# Some features of Flask  
 - Flask comes by default with a template rendering engine called [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/) that will help you create the dynamic pages of your web application.
 - It provides a project structure, that is, all the Apps that are built with Flask will have the same elements and the same files, which facilitates collaboration.
 - An infrastructure with a web server is not needed to test the applications, but in a simple way, a web server can be run to see the results that are obtained.
 - Flask does not have ORMs: But any of the following extensions can be used:
     - _[flask-script](https://flask-script.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Allows you to have a command line command to handle the application._
     - _[flask-Bootstrap](https://flask-bootstraplite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Style sheets for the page._
     - _[flask-WTF](https://flask-wtf.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) It is used to generate HTML forms with classes and objects._
     - _[flask-Sqlalchemy](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/) It is used to generate the data model._
     - _[flask-login](https://flask-login.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Used for user and password authentication._
